# FRAMEWORKS search

Scripts for building a sqlite database of the frameworks archives and searching that database

-----

FRAMEWORKS search contains the latest database archive of all FRAMEWORKS messages from 2002-2018 as well as tools for building the database from archived text files and searching/filtering the data.

Used in conjunction with [FRAMEWORKS archiver](https://github.com/sixteenmillimeter/frameworks_archiver) a complete archive of the FRAMEWORKS listserv can be downloaded and built into a searchable archive.
